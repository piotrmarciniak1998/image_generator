# 👨‍💻 Project: image_generator
Project for generating images used as a data set. Work in progress.
# 🚧 TODO
1. Main script which randomizes position of camera and items on the table and then saves all the needed images.
2. Improvements to code quality.
3. If possible, add functionality to display how much visible/ obstructed is the object.
# 💾 Installation through bash
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/piotrmarciniak1998/image_generator/
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
```
# 🔨 Components 
`.launch` files: 
* `image_generator.launch` - main Gazebo world.
* `empty.launch` - empty Gazebo world.
* `kinect.launch` - Gazebo world with Kinect sensor.

`.py` scripts executed normally:
* `convert_obj_to_urdf` - converts any `*.obj` to `*.urdf` and creates a `.pickle` that is used for storing
data about objects in the project. **This script should be executed to ensure that the project works properly.**

`.py` scripts working only through `rosrun`:
* `spawn_all_urdfs.py` - spawns all `.urdf` objects generated by `convert_obj_to_urdf.py` in Gazebo.
* `playground.py` - enables limited management over Gazebo, used for testing out new components.
* `node.py` - saves rgb image taken by kinect (temporary file)

`.py` services:
* `image_saver_server.py` - saves image with specified filename and with given index
# ▶️ Usage
1. It is recommended to execute `convert_obj_to_urdf.py`:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/image_generator/scripts
python3 convert_obj_to_urdf.py
```
2. Use chosen `roslaunch` file:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch image_generator image_generator.launch
```
3. Use chosen `rosrun` script in a separate tab:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun image_generator spawn_all_urdfs.py
```
